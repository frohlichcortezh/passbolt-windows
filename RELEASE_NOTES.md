Passbolt v0.6.0, named "Summer is Ending", introduces exclusive features for Pro users, alongside enhancements available to everyone. These updates are geared towards empowering teams with even more control and flexibility over their password management practices.

At the heart of this release is the introduction of the Password Expiry feature, a much-anticipated functionality that allows administrators to enable the automatic expiry policy, enhancing security by ensuring that potentially passwords are rotated when someone loses access to resources, for example by leaving a group or the organization.

A standout feature of this release for Passbolt Pro Edition is the advanced Password Expiry settings. Administrators now have the ability to define comprehensive password expiry policies, ensuring that your team's password hygiene is not just compliant with industry standards but also customized to fit your organization's specific needs. This feature is complemented by the ability for users to mark passwords as expired and adjust expiry dates directly, providing both oversight and flexibility in managing sensitive information.

In addition to the Pro-exclusive features, this release brings shared enhancements with Passbolt CE, such as the inclusion of Russian language support, integration with Microsoft 365 and Outlook for SMTP settings, and the activation of the desktop application feature by default for an improved user experience.

Thank you for your ongoing support. Your feedback and contributions continue to shape Passbolt, enhancing our collective security and usability. Together, we're making password management better for everyone.
